The goal of this program is to compare the number of swaps and comparisons in various sorting algorithms on different data sets. The program generates five data sets:
Data Set A = 100 random integers
Data Set B = 1000 random integers
Data Set C = 10000 random integers
Data Set D = 10000 numbers: 10000, 9999, 9998, 9997,É3,2,1
Data Set E = 10000 numbers consisting of 5000 odd numbers 1, 3, 5,É,9999 followed by 	      5000 even numbers 2, 4, 6, É, 10000 in this order

The program then runs the following tests on each of these data sets and prints out the number of swaps and comparisons for each:
-selection sort
-insertion sort
-heap sort
-merge sort
-quick sort

Special Instructions: 

If running a different data set, please use integers only, you can use negative or positive integers.
